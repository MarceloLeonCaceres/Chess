## Chess game

This code comes from the youtube tutorial "Programming a Chess Game in C#" (youtube.com/OttoBotCode), which was pretty impresive, there are 19 videos, and the explanations are very clear.

I will try to add some features, like turning back some moves (obviously you cannot do this in a real chess game), but is very practical when you are analyzing a game.

I will also try to "rotate" the board. By now, the white pieces are located on the "lower" part of the board (screen), and the black piecec are located in the upper part.
The pieces in the lower part of the board generally represent the pieces of the user, in this case myself. So when I play with the black pieces, I want to see my pieces in the lower section.
